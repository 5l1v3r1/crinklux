A linker script hack to make small 4k demos on Linux, using dynamic loading
of libraries to avoid the ELF dynamic linking overhead, and hand-crafted ELF
headers to minimize bloat.

A basic "draw a triangle on the screen" GLUT demo is about 1k or so.

This is old stuff that I never really did anything with, and surely there are
better toolkits out there by now.
